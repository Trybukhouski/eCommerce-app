Available Scripts and Usage

1. **start**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to start the development server.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - **Description**: It sets the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to development and then runs webpack to serve the application. The `--open` flag automatically opens the default browser to the served application.

1. **dev**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to build the application in development mode.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **Description**: Similar to the `start` script, it sets the `NODE_ENV` variable to development and runs webpack to build the application. However, it does not start a development server.

1. **build**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to build the application for production.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - **Description**: Sets the `NODE_ENV` variable to production and runs webpack to build the application optimized for production deployment.

1. **lint**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to run linting on the source code files.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run lint
     ```
   - **Description**: It uses ESLint to perform linting on JavaScript (`*.js`), JSX (`*.jsx`), TypeScript (`*.ts`), and TypeScript JSX (`*.tsx`) files within the `src` directory. The `--quiet` flag suppresses output of ESLint warnings.

1. **lint:fix**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to automatically fix linting issues in the source code files.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run lint:fix
     ```
   - **Description**: Similar to the `lint` script, it runs ESLint on the source code files but with the `--fix` flag, which automatically fixes fixable issues.

1. **format:check**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to check if the code formatting meets the defined rules.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run format:check
     ```
   - **Description**: It uses Prettier to check if the formatting of JavaScript (`*.js`), JSX (`*.jsx`), TypeScript (`*.ts`), and TypeScript JSX (`*.tsx`) files within the `src` directory complies with the defined rules.

1. **format**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to automatically format the source code files.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run format
     ```
   - **Description**: It uses Prettier to automatically format JavaScript (`*.js`), JSX (`*.jsx`), TypeScript (`*.ts`), and TypeScript JSX (`*.tsx`) files within the `src` directory, ensuring that all code adheres to the defined styling rules.

1. **prepare**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to set up Husky, a Git hook manager.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm run prepare
     ```
   - **Description**: Husky is a tool used to manage Git hooks. This script is likely used to configure Husky for use within the project.

1. **test**:
   - **Usage**: This script is used to run tests.
   - **Command**:
     ```
     npm test
     ```
   - **Description**: It runs Jest to execute tests within the project.

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - **Description**: The scripts use the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to distinguish between development and production environments. You can adjust other environment variables as needed for your specific setup.


## Getting Started üî•

Before you begin development, you need to set up your local environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - To get started with the eCommerce application, first clone the repository to your local machine.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
     ```
   - Replace `yourusername` and `your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     cd your-repository-name
     npm install
     ```
   - This command will download and install all the dependencies defined in your `package.json` file which are required to run the application.


## Running the Project üöÄ

1. **Development Mode**:
   - To start the development server and run the application in development mode, use the following command:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   This command sets the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `development` and starts the webpack development server. The application will automatically open in your default web browser.

1. **Building for Development**:
   - If you want to build the application for development without starting the development server, you can run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   This command sets the `NODE_ENV` variable to `development` and builds the application using webpack.

1. **Building for Production**:
   - To build the application for production, use the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   This command sets the `NODE_ENV` variable to `production` and builds the application optimized for production deployment.
